  - title: Why did we start Sangam?
    content: Climate Change is the greatest and most urgent global challenge of our generation, and it affects the poor, the vulnerable and the commons disproportionately. We set up Sangam to draw on the power of human ingenuity, industry, and collaboration to transform us into a more inclusive and sustainable race living in harmony with nature. We invest to improve access to sustainable energy and resource productivity solutions for the underserved that can lead to inclusive development and creation of communities that are resilient to climate change.
  - title: Is investing in a fund the best way to fight climate change?
    content: Most of Climate Change is anthropogenic (human-driven). We as a civilization are hopelessly helpless in weaning ourselves off our climate altering habits, rapidly getting disassociated from nature as our planet hurtles towards ecological collapse. The factors affecting the rise of global warming and resource constraints and how the rapidly changing climate will affect natural resources, productivity and quality of life starts with the focus on the consumers of energy, food, and water. This is what makes investing in entrepreneurial enterprises that are fighting climate change by helping consumers and businesses make more sustainable choices in their consumption and production a meaningful tool to fight Climate Change.
  - title: Are you an impact-first fund?
    content:  Yes, we are an impact first fund. Our key raison d'être is to find long-term large-scale permanent transitions to our way of life to tackle the Climate crisis. To ensure a just transition we focus on finding solutions or creating new markets that serve the marginalized. <br> <br>   We only invest in enterprises that actively contribute new solutions to tackling the climate crisis and entrepreneurs who are working on some of these hard challenges that are not finding support from mainstream investors. Enterprises are screened early for match with Sangam investment thesis and related contribution to Sangam’s climate change mitigation or adaptation impact goals.
  - title: Where do you invest? What is the sectoral focus?
    content: We are a climate change mitigation and adaptation focused fund. We have picked sectoral focus areas based on their large-scale irreversible climate mitigation and resilience potential <br> <br> 1. Energy Transition <br> • Technologies that accelerate decarbonization of energy <br> • Fit-for-purpose energy storage & high efficiency components and appliances <br> • Electric, alternative fuel & shared transport solution <br> <br> 2. Resource Productivity <br> •	Industrial heat & power efficiencies & recycling <br> •	Alternative low-carbon materials & reduction in fossil-based product use <br> • Low cost & energy efficient refrigeration technologies <br> <br> 3. Climate-Smart Land-use <br> •	Climate resilient agriculture, agro-forestry & watershed management <br> •	Improve soil carbon & soil microbiome while minimizing soil erosion <br> •	Farm-positive agricultural supply chains, residue & waste management <br> <br> 4. Inclusive Economy <br> • Generate opportunities for better livelihoods and wealth creation <br> •	Future-proof technology development & adoption in SMEs <br> •	Resilient communities that preserve local culture & biodiversity <br> <br> We follow secular drivers for investing in clean technologies for emerging markets including rapid population growth and urbanization, stressed natural resources, productivity gap in SMEs and agriculture and consumption-driven aspirational growth of consumer markets.

  - title: What differentiates you from other investors? What is the additionality of the fund?
    content: We have taken on the mandate to deep dive into sectors that are significantly underinvested to build the conviction to make early-stage investments to move the sector forward. This allows us to see opportunities where others don’t. Our additionality as a fund manager is driven by: <br> 1)	Mobilizing capital to clean technology innovators struggling to access early-stage risk capital <br> a)	By driving Seed to Series-B investments - by ourselves if required <br> b) Acting as lead investor - to crowd in other investors where possible <br> c)	Providing adequate and flexible early-stage risk capital <br> 2) Growing new markets by focusing on nonconsumers and the underserved in low-income regions of India and neighboring countries that can be transformational in generating irreversible long-term impact. <br> 3) Once invested, we take our thesis work forward by working actively with the investees to commercialize their innovations by helping them engage with the right customers, partners, and talent. Along the way, we create great inclusive places to work. <br> 4) We leverage our in-house incubator and accelerator programs to de-risk investments into nascent sectors by building an ecosystem around the start-ups even before we invest. 
  - title: How do you source deals?  Can we get good pipeline?
    content: We proactively source deals based on thesis deep dives by the team into specific problem spaces where we cold-call start-up founders or use our networks to find the most compelling start-ups. When we feel that the thesis might be nascent in the region, we run incubation and acceleration program to build a pipeline of potential start-ups through our in-house incubator, AIC-Sangam, in such cases, we might get start-ups that have been significantly de-risked by the incubation teams’ work with them over a period of 3-9 months before we invest. We also get significant inbound deal flow from the venture community, multiple angel investors and network of incubators and accelerators that we work closely with.
  - title: Do you lead rounds?
    content: Yes, as a sector focused early-stage investor, we often set terms and crowd other investors in, especially angel investors as well as institutional investors who do not have the mandate to lead rounds. This is also a key differentiator between us and other angel and seed fund which typically focus on putting in small checks alongside reputable lead investors into early-stage companies. Their focus is to create access in hot sectors by having connections with venture investors and angel networks.
  - title: What is your return expectation and exit horizons?
    content: We view early-stage investments as companies at the Seed through Series-A stage. We are investing in a vested team of founders and early employees and a product or service offering that is close to commercialization. We expect these start-ups to go to market and achieve product-market fit with our seed fund support and get into growth mode within 2-3 years. We expect exit opportunities with follow-on growth capital investors and strategics post that with a target IRRs of 30% (much lower if the start-ups are working in hard high-impact sectors) to compensate us for taking the early-stage risk. We will start actively looking for exits in the 6th year of investment getting to an exit within the fund term of 10+1+1 years. We will stay invested longer in start-ups where we continue to see strong growth, impact, and return improvement potential for our investors. <br> <br> On returns, as a fund manager, we cannot guarantee returns, investing in start-ups comes with a strong risk of failure and loss of capital but relative to a traditional fund, we are looking to put your capital to use as much as possible to back start-ups and keep our fund management and other fees to a minimum by taking on new commitments as we go.
  - title: How do you measure climate change impact? Do you track the ESG risks in your investments?
    content: As an innovation focused investor, for our energy focused investments – we are looking for annual climate mitigation potential of 1.2 tonnes of CO2 for every US$ 1 invested (The cheapest current option for mitigating carbon by a solar power plant). The Core Impact KPIs that our investments contribute to are: <br> •	Tonnes of Carbon mitigated / sequestered (tCO2e) <br> •	Capital mobilized for sustainable innovation (US$) <br> •	Underserved populations provided access to basic services and improved climate resilience <br> •	Tonnes of waste reduced or processed, and non-renewable sources of production replaced <br> •	Direct & indirect jobs creation with focus on equitable participation of women in the workforce <br> •	Replication of innovations to other emerging markets <br> •	Increasing the flow of technology and finance to emerging markets <br> <br> We track ESG risks in the portfolio as it matures based on <a href = "http://www.ifc.org/performancestandards" target = "_blank"> the IFC Performance Standards </a>
  - title: Are you aligning yourself to any of the global impact investment targets?
    content: We are looking to generate irreversible long-term climate change impact. Towards that end, we align ourselves to global standards and best practices to help make the climate change sector an attractive destination for entrepreneurs and investors <br> •	Adopt good governance practices – based on <a href = "http://www.ifc.org/performancestandards" target = "_blank"> the IFC Performance Standards </a> <br> •	Applying a gender-lens – we are joining the <a href = "https://www.2xchallenge.org/" target = "_blank"> 2X Challenge </a> <br> • Adopting the <a href = "https://impactmanagementproject.com/" target = "_blank"> Impact Management Project's </a> principles to define fund manager’s contribution <br> • Aligning ourselves to the <a href = "https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/" target = "_blank"> UN Sustainable Development Goals </a> and <a href = "https://iris.thegiin.org/document/iris-and-giirs/" target = "_blank"> GIIRS Impact Ratings </a>
