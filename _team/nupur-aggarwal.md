I am a sustainability enthusiast who is deeply interested in decoding the business value of Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) and evaluating impact oriented ESG solutions.

Currently at Sangam, I am contributing to Impact Management and Measurement (IMM) and ESG practices for impact investments in early and growth stage companies in the field of sustainable agriculture, inclusive economy, and sustainable production and consumption, with a focus on gender, climate, employment, equitable access, and livelihood generation.

I also assist in investment research and independently create, update, and forecast financial models for the portfolio companies and the pipeline start-ups. 

I have a strong interest in investing, with a particular interest in exploring the ESG trends as well as ESG policies and impact of the companies under coverage.

An entrepreneur at heart, I am always looking for new and exciting opportunities to learn and grow. I find it very exciting to interact with start-ups and learn about the innovative solutions they are building. I feel gratitude for having the opportunity to contribute to the long-term impact being created.
I have been associated with Sangam since August,2021. I hold a MSc. in Finance from Singapore Management University and have experience in financial markets and investment research. 

I am eager to expand my exposure, while building a toolkit of resilient and transferable problem-solving skills.
