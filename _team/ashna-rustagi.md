At Sangam, I focus on outreach into the start-up and innovation eco-system to identify new investment opportunities aligned with the fund’s Agriculture thesis – Climate Smart Land Use. That also involves leading acceleration programs that align with our agriculture investment thesis. 

Born, brought up in Delhi-NCR, India, I have experienced the negative impacts of Climate Change first hand. I feel extremely fortunate my work at Sangam enables me to be a part of the solution to the biggest challenge our world faces.

I love that a big part of my work involves speaking with founders across the country that are building new products and services for a sustainable and hopeful future. What really excites me are the field visits, where I get to speak with the beneficiaries and witness the ground-level operations and the grassroot and long-term impact the venture is creating!

Prior to Sangam, I worked with EY India in their Risk Advisory practice for 2.5 years and completed my bachelors in commerce from University of Delhi.
